# 3D-Family-Tree-Graph
The vision of this project is to provide and emersive 3D experience for exploring your Family History.
This project should be the foundation for:
 - A fun interactive playground for exploration, discovery, challenges, and learning (Think Quests and Side Quests)
 - Bringing your family history out of the dark and into an interactive world will motivate you to correct errors, collect more details and connect with your family.

## Features
- **3D Family Tree Visualization**: Explore your family tree in an immersive 3D environment
- **RootsMagic Database Support**: Load and visualize family data from RootsMagic (.rmtree, .rmgc) databases
- **GEDCOM File Support**: Import and convert GEDCOM (.ged) files to explore genealogy data
- **Auto-load Default Data**: Automatically loads HofstetterFamilyTree.rmtree on first launch
- **Interactive Exploration**: Navigate through generations, view family relationships, and discover your heritage

## Data Support
This project now supports two primary data formats:

### RootsMagic Databases (.rmtree, .rmgc)
- Native support for RootsMagic database files
- Includes the HofstetterFamilyTree.rmtree as example data with 511 individuals

### GEDCOM Files (.ged)
- Automatically converts GEDCOM files to RootsMagic SQLite format
- Preserves family relationships, dates, and genealogy information
