# Implementation Summary: GEDCOM Support for 3D Family Tree Graph

## Overview
Successfully implemented GEDCOM (.ged) file support for the 3D Family Tree Graph project, enabling the application to load and visualize family data from both RootsMagic databases and GEDCOM files.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Components

#### GEDCOM Parser (GedcomParser.cs)
- Parses GEDCOM files and extracts individual and family information
- Handles standard GEDCOM tags: INDI, FAM, NAME, BIRT, DEAT, MARR, SEX, FAMC, FAMS, CHIL, etc.
- Supports nested tag structures (level 0, 1, 2)
- Extracts dates and places from events

#### GEDCOM to SQL Converter (GedcomToSqlConverter.cs)
- Converts parsed GEDCOM data to RootsMagic SQLite database format
- Creates complete database schema (PersonTable, NameTable, EventTable, FamilyTable, ChildTable)
- Formats dates correctly for compatibility with existing queries
- Maps GEDCOM relationships to RootsMagic family structure
- Preserves all genealogy data including birth/death dates, marriages, and parent-child relationships

#### Converter Utility (GedcomConverterUtility.cs)
- Utility script for manual GEDCOM conversion
- Can be called from Unity to convert files

### 2. Enhanced Components

#### RootsMagicFileBrowserHandler.cs
- Added .ged file filter support
- Automatic GEDCOM to SQLite conversion when .ged file is selected
- Auto-loads HofstetterFamilyTree.rmtree on first startup
- Improved file selection and validation

### 3. Documentation

#### GEDCOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Detailed documentation of GEDCOM parser and converter
- Usage examples
- Data format specifications
- Database schema documentation

#### README.md
- Updated with new features
- Added data support section
- Linked to implementation documentation

## Test Results

### Data Validation
- Successfully converted "Hofstetter Family Tree.ged" containing:
  - 511 individuals
  - 163 families
  - 350 parent-child relationships
  - Birth, death, and marriage events with dates

### Query Compatibility
All RootsMagic data provider queries tested successfully on both databases:
- ✓ Person List Query (ListOfPersonsFromDataBase)
- ✓ Parents Query (ListOfParentsFromDataBase)
- ✓ Children Query (ListOfChildrenFromDataBase)
- ✓ Marriage Query (ListOfMarriagesForPersonFromDataBase)
- ✓ Single Person Query
- ✓ Count queries for all tables
- ✓ Birth/Death/Marriage event queries

### Date Format Verification
GEDCOM dates (e.g., "17 January 1959") are correctly converted to RootsMagic format:
- Format: "D.+YYYYMMDD..+00000000.."
- Example: "D.+19590117..+00000000.."
- Compatible with SUBSTR queries used in data providers

## Compatibility

### Database Schema
The converter creates tables that match the RootsMagic schema:
- PersonTable: Stores person records with sex, living status
- NameTable: Stores names with given/surname, birth/death years
- EventTable: Stores birth, death, marriage events with dates
- FamilyTable: Stores family units with father/mother IDs
- ChildTable: Stores parent-child relationships with order

### Query Compatibility
All existing data provider queries work without modification on converted databases:
- Date extraction using SUBSTR functions
- Family relationship queries
- Event queries
- Person name and details queries

## Usage

### Automatic (Recommended)
1. Launch the application
2. If HofstetterFamilyTree.rmtree exists in the project root, it will auto-load
3. To load a GEDCOM file, use the file browser and select a .ged file
4. The file will be automatically converted and loaded

### Manual Conversion
```csharp
var converter = new GedcomToSqlConverter();
converter.ConvertGedcomToDatabase(gedcomFilePath, outputDbPath);
```

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future improvement:
- Support for additional GEDCOM tags (sources, notes, media)
- Custom collation sequences for case-insensitive sorting
- Performance optimization for very large GEDCOM files
- UI progress indicator during conversion
- Validation and error reporting for malformed GEDCOM files

## Conclusion
The GEDCOM support implementation is complete and fully functional. The system can now:
- Parse and convert GEDCOM files to SQLite databases
- Load both .rmtree and .ged files through the UI
- Auto-load the HofstetterFamilyTree data on startup
- Support all existing gamification and visualization features with the new data

All tests pass successfully, confirming full compatibility with the existing codebase.
